### Is LibCal making you super sads? Use this handy dandy tool to make rules for your offerings

### BUT HOW
1. Clone (or fork and clone if you want to remix)
1. Add your super awesome LibCal csv file to the `./secretCSV/` directory
1. Open script.js and edit...

    ```
    const filePath = './secretCSV/fileName.csv'; // change this fileName to your file name
    ```

1. From the command line from within the repo directory, run `$ node script.js`

### NOTE:

This lil algorhythm assumes MUCH about the formatting of your `csv`. PLEASE TAKE CARE.
